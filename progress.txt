created a base UDP client server to send and receive messages. 
Plan for next time: investigate how to create congestion control for UDP.

update 21/2/22:
worked on the gui, added few buttons that directly associate with the client functions and a text box to receive messages from the user.

update 22/2/22:
made the client and server communication with object oriented.
made the gui to be able to communicate with the client.
completely removed the pygame file and moved to use tkinter library as gui.
